	VPATH, removed inclusion of tclconfig/installFile.tcl and
	tclconfig/mkinstalldirs in dist: target.

	* tcl.m4: Look for CYGWIN_98 and CYGWIN_95 environments, not just
	CYGWIN_NT.  Also search for executables with the $EXEEXT extension
	in SC_PROG_TCLSH and SC_PROG_WISH so that we don't pick up MS VS
	junk files.
	* configure.in:  Changes to support building on Win 95/98 using
	the cygwin environment.
