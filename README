CONTENTS
========
The following is a short description of the files you will find in
the sample extension.

Makefile.in	Makefile template.  The configure script uses this file to
		produce the final Makefile.

README		This file

README.cygwin	Instructions on how to use the Cygwin tools on Windows to
		build the sample extension.

README.sha	A description of the extension itself.

aclocal.m4	Generated file.  Do not edit.  Autoconf uses this as input
		when generating the final configure script.  See "tcl.m4"
		below.

configure	Generated file.  Do not edit.

configure.in	Configure script template.  Autoconf uses this file as input
		to produce the final configure script.

install-sh	Program used for copying binaries and script files to
		their install locations.

mkIndex.tcl.in	Script template used for generating an installed pkgIndex.tcl
		file.  The configure script uses this as input to produce the
		actual mkIndex.tcl script.

mkinstalldirs	Program used to create a directory heirarchy (because
		mkdir -p is not portable)

exampleA.c	Core Secure Hash Algorithm code.

exampleA.h	Header file for functions in the C files.

sha1.n		Unix nroff man page

tcl.m4		Collection of Tcl autoconf macros.  This file should be copied
		to aclocal.m4 before running autoconf.

tclexampleA.c	Implementation of new Tcl command "sha1".

tea.pdf		PDF file describing the current implementation of the
		Tcl Extension Architecture
